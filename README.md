SUMMARY
Our system basically solves the problem of online tests being fair and credible, which is a big deal because it can lower the value of digital degrees for everyone. We built it as a simple plugin that fits right into Moodle. During an exam, our AI works quietly in the background to create a fair environment. We use Computer Vision to make sure the right person is taking the test and to track eye movement, while Natural Language Processing (NLP) listens for any suspicious background talking. It also locks the browser to prevent searching for answers and then gives the instructor a simple report with any flagged moments. It's just a much more scalable and trustworthy way to handle online exams.
